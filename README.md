<!-- We've seen that note-taking tools usually just store text.
But SpringNote-Agenda treats notes as something that grows over time.
Instead of static records, we model a living system:
  .     *   .       .        o        .       *     .   .
    .   .      |     .    .        .     .     *   .     .
       --o--           SpringNote-Agenda           .      |   .
    *    |      .   capture → organize → reflect → grow
 .    .     .     .        .        .     .   --*--   .
      .        *      .        .     .        |     .  .

## Why SpringNote-Agenda

Writing down one thing is easy — but organizing many scattered notes together takes time, and it's why many people struggle to keep a consistent journaling habit.

SpringNote-Agenda removes the organizing step: record your thoughts and daily moments anytime, and AI organizes them into daily, weekly, and monthly reports — turning scattered fragments into a complete whole automatically.

With "Memories", you can also search and chat with your past notes, bringing back anything you once wrote down.

SpringNote-Agenda aims to make recording your life easier to stick with, with the help of AI.


## Core Features

- **Home Dashboard**: Activity heatmap, quick input box, and today's summary card.

  ![SpringNote-Agenda Home](./snapshots/index.png)

- **AI-Powered Generation**: Quickly jot down ideas on the home page, and AI automatically organizes them into structured content.

- **Note Editor**: Supports daily, weekly, and monthly notes, with Markdown editing, preview, code block highlighting, and AI completion suggestions.

- **Project Calendar**: Detects deadlines written in notes and displays them in a calendar with overdue, due-today, and upcoming reminders. Supported examples: `Due: 2026-08-30`, `Deadline: 2026/08/30`.

- **Memories Chat**: Retrieve and organize your memories through conversation, with visible thinking process, tool call display, and Markdown rendering.

- **Automatic Report Generation**: On startup, fills in missing weekly/monthly reports based on existing daily or weekly notes.

- **Statistics Panel**: View records, activity, model calls, and data overviews across time ranges.

## Quick Start

### Download & Install

#### Download from GitHub

Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/Adorable-Qin/SpringNote-Agenda/releases/latest) to download SpringNote-Agenda.

### Step 1: Confirm the Data Directory

Before first use, confirm where your data will be stored. Daily, weekly, and monthly notes, images, and related configs are all saved around this directory.

![Data Directory](./snapshots/datadir.png)


### Step 2: Configure AI

We use **DeepSeek** as an example:

#### ① Add a provider — set the BaseURL to https://api.deepseek.com/beta

>
> The `beta` path is used here because of DeepSeek's [FIM API requirements](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/guides/fim_completion).
>
> For other OpenAI-compatible APIs, fill in the BaseURL according to your provider's documentation.
>

![Step 1](./snapshots/configone.png)

#### ② Manually add the model `deepseek-v4-flash`

>
> DeepSeek's `beta` endpoint does not support listing models, so the model must be added manually.
>

![Step 2](./snapshots/configtwo.png)

#### ③ Edit the model

>
> Manually check the completion capability option.
>

![Step 3](./snapshots/configthree.png)

#### ④ Select the default model

>
> If a model doesn't support completion, it won't appear in the completion model list.
>

### Step 3: Create Your First Note

![Home](./snapshots/index.png)


### Step 4: View and Edit in the Notebook

![Notebook](./snapshots/note.png)

Click **New** in the notebook and choose a date to create a daily, weekly, or monthly note. Existing notes for that period are opened directly. Right-click a note to delete it after confirmation. Manually deleted weekly and monthly reports are excluded from automatic startup generation.

Under **Settings → Preferences → Work cycle**, choose weekly or biweekly meetings. Biweekly meetings enable a **Biweekly report** type: select two weekly reports to create an editable combined report. Source reports are preserved, and merging the same pair again opens the existing result. Switching back to weekly meetings preserves saved biweekly reports.

Notebook search searches the selected note type. Enter at least two characters to search.

### Work plans

Open **Work plans** from the sidebar. Monthly cards on the left keep each month's summary and next month's plan together. The editable weekly board on the right lets you switch between saved weeks. Each side has a **New** button and saves edits automatically.

Dated tasks in plans, such as `- [ ] 2026-10-09 Finish proposal` or `- [ ] Finish proposal — Due: 2026-10-09`, appear automatically in the project calendar. Date changes, removed tasks, and completion updates are reflected in the plans and calendar.

### Step 5: Use Memories

![Memories](./snapshots/memories.png)

In "Memories", you can directly ask questions about your saved work records.

### Step 6: Manage Deadlines in the Project Calendar

Write a deadline in any daily, weekly, or monthly note, for example:

```markdown
- Prepare the release notes — Due: 2026-08-30
- Submit the proposal — Deadline: 2026/09/05
```

Open **Project Calendar** from the sidebar to see overdue, due-today, and upcoming items. Completed Markdown tasks such as `- [x] ...` are ignored.

### Keep Exploring

After finishing the basics, you can continue configuring in Settings. For more usage instructions, see the [documentation](./docs).
